Successful authentication is a prerequisite for the processing of any on-line or offline CEPS transaction;sec 
On-line authentication must take place between the card issuer and the CEP card for load, unload, and currency exchange transactions;sec 
The card issuer and the CEP card share a secret key to generate and verify MACs;sec 
Specification of keys and signatures used for CEPS on-line authentication is left to the issuer, however MACs passed over shared networks must be no more than 8 bytes long, binary format;sec 
Off-line authentication must take place between a PSAM in the POS device and the CEP card for purchase and cancel last purchase transactions;sec 
The card and the PSAM must use a public key algorithm for mutual authentication and session key exchange, as no permanent shared secret key may exist between the CEP card and the PSAM;sec 
To load value into a slot of the CEP card securely, the load device establishes a connection between the issuer and the CEP card;sec 
The card should use a unique diversified secret key, personalized into the card, to generate and authenticate transaction signatures;sec 
In the case of an unlinked load, no presumption may be made as to the business relationship between the cardholder, the funds issuer, the card issuer, or the load acquirer;sec 
If this is not a cash load, the funds issuer needs to verify that the funds are requested by the legitimate account owner, which is normally done by the presentation of an enciphered PIN;sec 
The card issuer needs to ensure that the load acquirer is guaranteeing payment for the electronic value, and that the card is authentic;sec 
The load acquirer needs to ensure that the issuer is the true owner of the card, and, in the case of an apparent failure of the load, the load acquirer needs the card presented to authenticate the failure;sec 
Finally, the load acquirer and issuer need to ensure that the load cannot be completed by another entity;sec 
The card generates S1 using card and load device data, and sends S1 to the load device to be forwarded to the issuer;sec 
The load device sends S1 in an authorization request to the issuer;sec 
The load device also provides for verification of the identity of the cardholder (with either on-line or off-line PIN verification) and forwards verification data in the authorization request;sec 
The issuer validates S1 to authenticate the card and the data to be used in the transaction;sec 
The card issuer determines whether to allow the load to complete, and generates S2, which secures the issuer’s decision and that the issuer received the same data used by the card;sec 
The issuer sends S2 to the load acquirer in the authorization response message;sec 
After validating S2 and completing the transaction, the card creates S3, which is logged by the load device or the load acquirer;sec 
If there is a reversal message, the S3 must be sent to the card issuer, if there is a settlement message sent to the card issuer after the S3 is generated, S3 should be included;sec 
Unloads are permitted only to an account controlled by the card issuer and are performed only at a load device under the control of the card issuer;sec 
The cardholder must have an account relationship with the card issuer, and funds removed from the card are credited to the cardholder account only after the card issuer authenticates the card;sec 
Cardholder verification is not necessary, but may be done;sec 
In a currency exchange transaction, funds flow from one slot within the card to another, and from one funds pool to another, both of which are under the control of the issuer;sec 
The issuer needs only to authenticate the card, and the card needs only to authenticate the issuer and that the data is the same as used by the issuer;sec 
The card generates S1, using data from the card and load device, and sends S1 to the card issuer to authenticate the card and the data that is to be used in the transaction;sec 
The card issuer validates S1, calculates the amount of the transaction into the new currency, and determines whether to allow the exchange to complete;sec 
The card issuer generates S2, which is sent to the card to allow the card to validate the card issuer’s authenticity and to ensure that the data used by the card in the transaction is the same as the card issuer intended;sec 
After completing the transaction, the card creates S3, which is logged by the load device or the load acquirer or both;sec 
In the case of an unsuccessful completion, exception processing outlined in the On-line Exception Processing section is performed;sec 
During a purchase transaction, the CEP card must ensure that it is dealing with an authentic POS device, and it must generate a signature to allow the card issuer to verify the integrity of the transaction;sec 
The POS device must ensure that it is dealing with an authentic card, and guarantee integrity of transactions and batches to the merchant acquirer;sec 
For multiple step transactions, the CEP card can, at the card issuer’s option, reauthenticate the PSAM at each step (mutual authentication), or it can rely on the authentication that was performed during the first step (dual authentication);sec 
The PSAM may authenticate the CEP card during each step;sec 
In the case of a reversal, the CEP card must re-authenticate the PSAM;sec 
Intermediate card validation by the POS device is optional for both the CEP card and the PSAM;sec 
The Cancel Last Purchase transaction is a very sensitive transaction because, like a load transaction, it may be used to add value to the electronic purse;sec 
However, unlike the load, the Cancel Last Purchase is performed off-line without opportunity for the card issuer to authenticate the card or to approve the transaction;sec 
The card must ensure that the transaction is performed by the same POS device as was used for the purchase being canceled, and that the amount of the cancellation is the same as the amount of the purchase, or, in the case of an incremental purchase, the same as the amount of the last step;sec 
During a Cancel Last Purchase transaction, the CEP card is authenticated by the PSAM in the POS device;sec 
The PSAM authenticates that the purchase transaction being canceled was performed by the PSAM, and that the transaction being canceled is part of the active batch;sec 
The card issuer and the merchant acquirer also authenticate the transaction when they receive it;sec 
Transmissions between host systems should be protected by MACs based on unique keys that are shared by the nodes involved;sec 
The transaction signatures ensure end to end integrity of transmitted data for load, unload, and currency exchange transactions;sec 
Every complete POS transaction is given a MAC by the PSAM and kept in the POS device memory until collected by the merchant acquirer;sec 
Each POS transaction is part of a batch of transactions that must be collected at the same time;sec 
Each batch must contain the total count and amount of the transactions in the batch;sec 
These totals are used by the merchant acquirer to ensure the integrity of the batch;sec 
The count and amount of the transactions in the batch must be protected by the S4 MAC,  This information is not part of the card issuer’s verification process;sec 
Scheme providers must assign unique identifying numbers to merchant acquirers who provide PSAMs;sec 
These merchant acquirers must then assign unique identifiers to PSAMs;sec 
As a result, each PSAM must have a unique ID composed of the scheme identifier, a merchant acquirer identifier, and the PSAM identifier;sec 
Each PSAM must maintain a transaction count, The unique PSAM ID and the transaction count are used during a conversation with a CEP card. The transaction count must not be reset during the life of the PSAM;sec

Send transactions to other processors in a standard format defined in agreement with the scheme provider;sec
Participate in a financial transaction with the connecting processors at the time that the transaction is sent or received. Funds move when the transaction moves;sec
If a supported scheme provider has a dispute resolution process, participate in that dispute resolution process with connecting processors to resolve any issues related to invalid transactions. These resolution processes should include a mechanism for repayment of funds associated with invalid transactions;sec 
The scheme provider must ensure that the entire process between merchants, merchant acquirers, card issuers, and processors is auditable and reconcilable;sec 
Transactions must be archived at all processing points after the POS device, The length of time that the transactions must be archived will vary by type of processing point;sec
Only transactions that have been validated are to be sent to a card issuer for payment, Payment is made when the transaction is received;sec
If errors in the card issuer MAC are discovered by the card issuer during its processing of the transactions, a dispute mechanism, established by the scheme provider, may be used to have money refunded;sec 
If a scheme provider establishes a central error repository, all transactions for the scheme with MAC errors must be sent to that central error repository whether or not they are submitted to the dispute process;sec 
Payment for a transaction is only required when a detail transaction is submitted for payment, A merchant acquirer may choose to pay the merchant using the batch total;sec
The timing of payment to the merchant must be established between the merchant and the merchant acquirer;sec 
If another application on a CEP transfers value from the CEP application, the transfer must be reported as a purchase transaction;sec 
A purchase transaction may be reversed, prior to the removal of the CEP card from the POS device, by sending a purchase reversal command to the CEP card, The CEP card must authenticate the PSAM using certificates previously exchanged;sec
Only the last increment of an incremental purchase may be reversed. A reversal of a purchase transaction may only occur if: the CEP card has not been removed from the POS device, and the S5 for the transaction to be reversed has not been generated by the PSAM;sec
The amount to be reversed is the amount of the last step of the transaction. The reversal command sent to the CEP card contains a S2 MAC computed by the PSAM;sec
The PSAM in the POS device generates a merchant acquirer S5 MAC for the transaction, computes a new S4 MAC on the updated batch total count and amount, and logs the transaction;sec
The transaction and MACs are kept in a data store associated with the POS device until the merchant acquirer collects them. The logged data must include the total amount of the purchase, the purchase amount that was reversed, and an indication that the transaction was reversed;sec
The CEP card authenticates the PSAM using the certificates previously received and the S2, The CEP card increments the value of the purse and logs the transaction;sec
The CEP card sends a response to the reversal command to the POS device. The reversal is considered to be successful even in the event of a negative response or no response from the CEP card;sec
POS devices are not required to support the cancel last purchase command. If this command is supported, the POS device must have security to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent use of the transaction;sec
This transaction is only valid if the transaction to be canceled is the last transaction completed by the CEP card. Additionally, the transaction to be canceled must not have been collected and must be in an active batch. Only the last step of an incremental purchase may be canceled;sec
After the CEP card is inserted in the POS device, the POS device initiates the cancel last purchase transaction;sec
If the POS device supports multiple applications or multiple transaction types, an interaction between the terminal and consumer or sales agent determines the CEP application and the function to be performed (cancel last purchase transaction);sec
The CEP card verifies that the PSAM is the PSAM used in the original transaction, computes a S1 MAC using the same DES session key that was used for the purchase transaction being cancelled, and responds to the POS device with the S1 and the identification of the last transaction. If the purchase transaction to be canceled has been canceled or is not part of the active batch, the command is not allowed;sec 
The PSAM either retrieves or re-derives the DES session key used for the purchase transaction being cancelled. The POS device authenticates the CEP card using this key and the S1 MAC;sec
The PSAM in the POS device generates a merchant acquirer S5 MAC for the transaction and a new S4 MAC for the batch total count and amount and logs the transaction. The amount of the canceled last purchase transaction is subtracted from the header amount. The transaction is kept in a data store associated with the POS device until the merchant acquirer collects it;sec
A credit command, which contains the S2 MAC computed by the PSAM using the session key, is sent to the CEP card;sec
The CEP card authenticates the terminal using the S2 MAC and the session key from the purchase transaction being cancelled. The CEP card increments the value of the purse and logs the transaction. The CEP card verifies that the cancellation amount is equal to the amount of the last step of the purchase transaction;sec
A transaction collection process must exist. Data being transmitted from the POS devices must be transmitted in a manner that ensures integrity of the data;sec
The merchant acquirer must acknowledge the receipt of the batch to either the POS device or the merchant. The timing of the acknowledgment will vary based on the collection process. After a batch has been acknowledged by the merchant acquirer, it may be deleted from the POS device;nonsec
The POS device closes the batch when the batch is collected. Collection may be initiated by the POS device, the merchant, or by the merchant acquirer;nonsec
The batch is sent to the merchant acquirer. Delivery may involve transmission to multiple intermediate locations or it may be direct to the merchant acquirer;nonsec
The merchant acquirer validates the batch to ensure that it has been transmitted correctly and enters it into the log;nonsec
Only certain POS devices, which have been installed at merchants approved for aggregation by both the scheme provider and merchant acquirer, must be permitted to aggregate transactions;nonsec
POS devices must only aggregate transactions from CEP cards when the CEP card allows aggregation;nonsec
The PSAM must only be permitted to aggregate transactions for a scheme with which the merchant has an aggregation agreement. The AID of the card application must be used to determine the scheme. For each scheme that allows this merchant to perform aggregation, the PSAM must have a monetary amount above which it is not permitted to aggregate;nonsec
If the business rules allow this transaction is to be aggregated, the PSAM must determine if it has an aggregation record for the card issuer. If the PSAM does not have an aggregation record for the card issuer, a new aggregation record for the card issuer must be created;nonsec
If the PSAM has insufficient space to create a new aggregation record for the card issuer, the transaction must not be aggregated;nonsec
If the transaction is to be aggregated, the amount of the transaction must be added to the aggregation record for the card issuer;nonsec
The count of aggregated transactions in the aggregation record must be increased by 1;nonsec
The PSAM must create a MAC on the updated aggregation record. Aggregation records by card issuer must be stored in the PSAM. They may also be stored in the POS device as well;nonsec
The PSAM must increase the total count and amount of the active batch by the amount of the aggregated transaction;nonsec
The aggregated totals by card issuer must be transmitted to the merchant acquirer at the same time and manner as the non-aggregated detail transactions in the batch;nonsec
Each POS transaction completed at the POS device is given a S5 MAC by the PSAM, which is used by the merchant acquirer to validate that the transactions were made at a POS device with a valid PSAM. The batch total count and amount must be protected by the S4 MAC, which must also be validated by the merchant acquirer;nonsec
The merchant acquirer validates the PSAM’s MACs prior to accepting the POS transactions for payment. In addition, selected data elements are validated to ensure correct processing by the POS device and its PSAM;nonsec
Each purchase transaction is signed by the CEP card with a S6 MAC, which is used by the card issuer to validate that the transaction was made with a legitimate, not counterfeit, CEP card. The card issuer validates the CEP card’s MAC;nonsec
Payment decisions are based on signature validations, scheme provider rules, and merchant and merchant acquirer agreements;nonsec
Errors may be introduced by a malfunctioning PSAM or POS device software, by key management problems, or through the transmission process, as well as through fraudulent activities of another entity. When a batch or POS transaction fails validation, the merchant acquirer or card issuer must follow exception procedures that affect payment to the merchants and payment from the card issuer. The batch must be analyzed to determine clearable transactions out of a corrupted batch;nonsec 
A transaction that fails a merchant acquirer validation cannot be forwarded for payment unless resolved;nonsec
After investigation, if the merchant acquirer decides, based on scheme rules, to accept the transactions, a method must exist to settle them and forward them to the card issuer;nonsec
Procedures for investigation, resubmission, and manual adjustment may be established between the merchant acquirer and its merchants for batches containing rejected transactions;nonsec
A transaction that passes merchant acquirer validations and is forwarded to the card issuer is paid for by the card issuer. If the transaction does not pass card issuer validations, the card issuer may follow the scheme provider’s dispute procedures;nonsec
Purchase transactions that have an invalid MAC are forwarded to the scheme provider for analysis if the scheme provider has established a central error repository;nonsec
Merchant acquirers may institute pay on header arrangements for providing payment to their merchants. In this arrangement, the merchant acquirer relies on the header validation to determine payment to the merchant if transaction detail is missing due to some problem. The specific rules covering pay on header arrangements are outside the scope of this document;nonsec
Pay on detail is the default payment arrangement for merchant acquirers to provide payment to their merchants. In this arrangement, the merchant acquirer relies on the POS transaction S5 MAC to determine acceptance. Merchants are paid only for valid POS transactions;nonsec
Valid batch total counts and amounts are required in any payment arrangement. Batches where the totals have errors that cannot be resolved through investigation must be rejected;nonsec
All POS transactions, except for duplicates, are forwarded to the card issuer. The following transactions are forwarded to the card issuer for payment and for CEP card history information: Common Electronic Purse Specifications - Functional Requirements - POS transactions that were accepted by the merchant acquirer. - POS transactions that have resolved errors are additionally flagged with an error code indicating the type of validation failure;nonsec
The card issuer pays based on the total amount of transactions forwarded by the merchant acquirer for payment;nonsec
POS transactions that were rejected for payment by the merchant acquirer are flagged with an error code indicating the type of validation failure and are forwarded to the card issuer for CEP card history information only;nonsec
All load transactions are on-line transactions. Authorization of funds for load transactions must require a form of cardholder verification. The load device must support on-line encrypted PIN or off-line PIN verification;nonsec
Off-line PIN verification must include both encrypted and unencrypted PIN;nonsec
The card verification method indicator (CVMI) in the CEP card must specify support of online PIN verification and at least one method of off-line PIN verification (encrypted or unencrypted);nonsec
Where it is necessary for a CEPS system component to distinguish between on-line and off-line cardholder PIN verification, a flag must be set in the transaction;nonsec
Since these transactions are on-line to the issuer, the issuer has the opportunity to lock the card or the application. These transactions are not available to a card that has already been locked;nonsec
Currency exchange rates for the currency exchange transaction must be established by the card issuer;nonsec
Currency exchange rates for unload transactions must be established by the card issuer when the currency being unloaded and the destination cardholder account are in different currencies;nonsec

Card issuers must inform their cardholders as to which currencies they support in electronic purses;nonsec
Load acquirers must determine the currencies that they must support for load transaction;nonsec
Load - Assume the transaction completed successfully. Funds are debited from the cardholder account and credited to the funds pool. The card issuer liability is increased;nonsec
Unload - Assume the transaction did not complete successfully. Funds are not withdrawn from the funds pool and liabilities are not altered;nonsec
Currency Exchange - Assume the transaction completed successfully. The funds pool and liability positions are adjusted to reflect a decrease in the “from” currency and an increase in the “to” currency;nonsec
The load acquirer must notify the card issuer of all suspect transactions;nonsec
The CEP application must contain data that indicates the presence of a linked financial institution. If a linked financial institution is established for the CEP application, then linked loads must be allowed and data in the application must indicate whether linked loads are supported;nonsec
Flexibility is required to accommodate the variety of environments where unlinked loads may be implemented. As a result, the design specification must not preclude dual-leg transactions** from taking place either sequentially or in parallel. The design of a given implementation will vary depending on the device, host, and network capabilities;nonsec
Unload and currency exchange transactions are optional for CEP card issuers. The CEP card must indicate whether the card issuer supports these transactions. However, if a card issuer issues multi-currency capable cards, it must provide its cardholder with a facility to remove any remaining value. As a result, if a card issuer supports loading of multiple currencies onto a card, then it must support the unload or currency exchange transaction or both;nonsec
For unload transactions, the load acquirer and card issuer must be the same financial institution. Load devices or load acquirers must be able to identify their own institution’s CEP cards;nonsec
The card issuer must establish its policies for assigning and adjusting slot maximum balances. These policies may require the card issuer to maintain a card database;nonsec
Currency exchange rate fluctuations may increase the card issuers liability. The card issuer must be able to adjust maximum balances to bring them in line with their policies. The card issuer may update the maximum balances as part of a load, a partial unload, and a currency exchange transaction. On a currency exchange transaction, only the “to” currency maximum balance may be updated;nonsec
The maximum balance for a currency must never be less than the existing balance for that currency plus the amount to be loaded, in case of a load transaction;nonsec
A CEP card may contain currencies that the load acquirer does not support. As a result, load devices must use the alphabetic issuer-supplied currency code and currency exponent from the CEP slot(s) to display the source amounts for the currency conversion transaction;nonsec
Card issuers must provide an alphabetic currency code in each message that establishes a new currency. This alphabetic currency code and the currency exponent will be used by the load device to display currency balances. This allows the cardholder to identify the currency being displayed;nonsec
Script messages that conform to EMV specifications may be included as part of load, unload and currency exchange messages from the card issuer to the CEP card. An update key must be used when card parameters are changed.

The card issuer must have the ability to deactivate a CEP application in the response to a load or currency exchange transaction;nonsec
The CEP card may support multiple currencies. Each currency occupies a “slot” within the CEP. The slots are defined by the currency supported. The currency for an individual slot is determined during load or currency exchange. Currency exchange could apply to a single slot, and then only for the total balance;nonsec
It is a card issuer’s decision to determine the currencies that are allowed to occupy slots in the CEP card. This decision is made by the card issuer during the load or currency exchange transaction, by approving or rejecting the request to authorize the transaction;nonsec
A single currency cannot occupy more than one slot. The CEP card must not permit a slot to be assigned a currency if another slot in the CEP card has already been assigned to that currency;nonsec
The CEP card limits each slot to a maximum balance. The maximum balance for a slot is established when a currency is assigned to the slot, and is determined externally by the card issuer or by CEP card data which indicates a maximum balance in a reference currency. There is no requirement that all slot maximums have the same relative value, and there is no requirement for the card to maintain a maximum total value;nonsec
The card must not allow a slot to exceed the maximum balance, and must reject any command that would raise the current balance above the maximum;nonsec
Only one version of the CA public key is required in the card. This requires that the PSAMs with which the CEP card exchanges cryptograms must be capable of generating and validating cryptograms using the relevant keys from all current cards;nonsec

Consumers must be able to load electronic value to their cards at any participating load device, regardless of the location, provided that the currency that is requested is supported by the acquirer and the card issuer;nonsec
Funds issuers must accept funds authorization requests, regardless of the load currency type, as permitted;nonsec
Home, or venue-based, loading must be from an account located at a financial institution;nonsec
The source of funds for a load may be independent from the issuer of the electronic purse card;nonsec

The electronic purse card issuer must reflect all changes in the value of a loaded card and the aggregate funds pool on their card databases and funds pool accounting systems (where separate);nonsec
The load acquirer must keep records by card number of all loads that take place at its load devices;nonsec
Cards should be unloaded to an account which is resident at the card issuer’s financial institution. (Unlinked unloads are not precluded but are out of the scope of CEPS.);nonsec
Unloads to cash (redemptions) are only permitted to resolve customer service issues, and must be performed at the issuer’s location;nonsec
Unload transactions do not require cardholder authentication. (However, an acquirer’s devices may be configured such that authentication is required for access.);nonsec
The architecture for the electronic purse should not preclude the eventual deployment of a variety of devices to meet the needs of many card acceptance environments. Unload must not be precluded from being supported on any or all of these devices at the option of the acquirer;nonsec
Unload transactions require the unload acquirer to provide consumers with the option of a receipt, as appropriate and subject to local regulations;nonsec
The scheme provider must have a processing function to perform the following: Distributing information required for security or compliance with the scheme rules and regulations;nonsec
